  <h1>Garlic  Salmon</h1>


  <p>This is one of my favorite recipes for when folks come over for dinner. I've
    already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is
    it's <em>so easy</em> to make!</p>


    <ul>

      <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>

      <li>2 T. soy sauce</li>

      <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>

      <li>2 t. dry mustard</li>

      <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>

      <li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li>

    </ul>


    <ol>

      <li>Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned
        and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate
        for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving
        sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece
        as well.)</li>

      <li>Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil
        the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking
        (I like it still pink in the center).</li>

      <li>I usually serve this with
          an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li>

        </ol>
