<h1>&diams; Nikki &diams;</h1>
<p>My journey with Graphic Design originated from my love for other artforms. From dance to music,
  I always have been driven to create. It is through those experiences that I found graphic design.
  My main inspiration has always been to be able to accomplish whatever artistic vision I have.
  Through this desire, I found graphic design and developed a desire to learn and grow as much
  as possible in this field. I am currently enrolled at Seminole State and am completing my A.S.
  in Digital Media with a Graphic Design specialization. After completing my degree, I aspire
  to continue expanding my experience and skills through freelance work.
